Actually, don't.

This work is based on ideas contained in a thesis (Image Texture Tools) by Paul
Francis Harrison (Monash University), described in chapter 7 - "Declarative
texture synthesis"

Quoting from said chapter: "The objective is to find a connected structure
composed only of pieces from a specified set. Pieces are based on squares or
hexagons with edges of various types. An edge of a certain type may only abut
edges of some other certain type. Some edges of a piece may be “empty”, and
these edges do not need to abut another piece. All other edges must abut an
appropriate opposite edge. Pieces may be rotated, but not flipped."
